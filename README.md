# Autonomous-RCcar

This project was my mini-project in 6th semester of my undergrad studies. (Feb-March 2018)

Uploading on Github with few changes. 

## Model-1:
  
  - It uses Smartphone camera placed on bot to capture frames using IP webcam app, these frames are relayed directly to laptop.
  - The images then used to train a CNN model.
  - To deploy it real time, smartphone camera will send images to laptop -> model in laptop will predict the direction -> this direction can be sent to bot via RF_module connected to laptop as well as bot serially.
  
## Model-2:
    
  - It uses raspberryPi camera placed on bot to capture frames, these frames are relayed directly to laptop.
  - The images then used to train a CNN model.
  - To deploy it real time, raspberryPi camera will send images to laptop -> model in laptop will predict the direction -> this direction can be sent to bot via RF_module connected to laptop as well as bot serially.
